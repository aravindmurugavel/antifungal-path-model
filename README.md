**PATH: Personalized Antifungal Treatment REcommendation**
**Streamlit App:** https://antifungal-path-model-sastra-ask-205.streamlit.app/ 

PATH (Personalized Antifungal Treatment Recommendation) is an AI-driven, open-source decision-support tool designed to provide patient-specific, first-line antifungal therapy recommendations. Developed using a Random Forest machine learning model, PATH addresses the challenge of rapidly selecting effective antifungal treatment, aiming to optimize therapy and improve clinical outcomes in fungal infections

**How PATH Works**
The model generates individualized treatment probabilities by integrating a comprehensive range of host and pathogen factors:
Patient Profile: It considers age, gender, and geographic location across 58 countries.
Clinical Context: It integrates data of 662 individual patients covering 181 medical histroy (underlying medical conditions).
Fungal Pathogens: It analyzes 41 fungal species (primarily within the Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucorales genera).
By synthesizing this evidence, PATH provides immediate, data-driven insights to guide clinicians in selecting the most effective antifungal agents and steroids for immediate care.

**How to use**
1. Select patient profile fields
2. Know the Fungal Pathogen
3. Click Predict Therapies
4. Review recommendations grouped by confidence

**Key Features**
**AI-Powered Predictions**: A Random Forest model with 92% validated accuracy to predict survival probabilities for over 15 Antifungal treatment options.
* **Comprehensive Data Integration**: The model considers:
    * **Patient Profile**: Age, gender, and geographic location across 50+ countries.
    * **Clinical Context**: Data from 661 individual patient cases covering 181 medical histories.
    * **Fungal Pathogens**: Analysis of 41 fungal species, primarily within *Aspergillus*, *Candida*, and *Mucorales* genera.
* **Interactive Interface**: An intuitive UI built with Streamlit that allows for easy input of patient data.
* **Clear Recommendations**: Results are grouped by confidence levels (High, Moderate, Low) for quick interpretation.
* **Data Visualization**: An interactive Plotly bar chart displays the top 10 treatment recommendations for easy comparison.

    ```

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

The recommendations generated by PATH are intended for **clinical decision support only** and must not be considered a final prescription or treatment directive. This tool is intended to assist clinicians and does not replace expert judgment. Confirmation of Antifungal Susceptibility via an in-vitro Antifungal Susceptibility Test (AFST) is mandatory.
